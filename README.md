# Dark Sun

This repo contains the developmental Dark Sun: Sands of Time module content.  If you want to contribute, please fork this repository and send a pull request when your testing is complete.

# Acknowledgements

Although there is a lot of original work in this module, there is also a lot of work that was contributed by many other builders and scripters who have graciously allowed their works to be used by the general public.  Since much of our systems rest on a central framework, a good bit of the contributed code had to be modified (in format, not in function) to make it work correctly in the module.  As humans, we suck at tracking the original scripts and since many individual scripts were deleted in favor of consolidating scripts into libraries, some of the original author blocks and statements have been lost to the ages.  Therefore, we are providing an [acknowledgements document](docs/acknowledgements.md) to ensure we're providing credit to those whose systems or code we have used here.  We have no intention of hiding, plagiarizing or otherwise minimizing the work you've done.  If you find that we're using something you wrote, and you're not mentioned in the acknowledgements, please contact us and we'll get you added.

# Manuals

We've provided several manuals for use by various levels of players and contributors at Dark Sun.  Please check out the following based on your role.  The manuals build on each other as you get further down the list, so don't expect the scripter's manual to go into detail on the death and corpse loot systems, that's what the player's and dungeon master's manuals are for.  You should be familiar with the content of each manual that is listed before your role:

* [~~Player's Manual~~ coming soon](docs/playersmanual.md)
* [~~Dungeon Master's Manual~~ coming soon](docs/dmmanual.md)
* [Builder's Manual (in development)](docs/buildersmanual.md)
* [Scripter's Manual (in development)](docs/scriptersmanual.md)

# Contributions

This section is provided for team members, or any potential contributors, in case they are not familiar with the tools we are using or what an effective work flow looks like.  If you're a seasoned developer or contributor, feel free to continue using your own processes.  You don't need permission to fork the repository and ask to contibute something.  If you don't know how to fork the repository, [check out our installation tools tutorial](docs/tools.md/#github-account).

## Development Tools

[Read the Tool Installation Tutorial](docs/tools.md)

For anyone that doesn't already have a development environment set on their machines, the [tool installation tutorial](docs/tools.md) will walk you through setting up the minimum tools you should have to enable an efficent development workflow.  You can develop without these tools, however, you will likely find that using them will save you countless hours of unnecessary work over the course of this module's development.  Also, any work you create that you cannot add to the repository yourself is creating unnecessary work for another member of the team.  So, live them, learn them, love them.  They really do save time.

## Workflow

[Read the Workflow Tutorial](docs/workflow.md)

The whole purpose of setting up these tools is to create an efficient development environment.  To that end, the workflow tutorial will walk you through using the various tools you installed in the tool installation tutorial and provide the foundation for quickly creating and deploying new content.

## Using VSCode as a Development Environment

[Read the VSCode Installation and Setup Tutorial (in development)](docs/vscode.md)

For the scripters among us, and even those who are more daring, I highly suggest using Visual Studio Code as your prefered development environment.  It is lightweight, agile, contains a powershell terminal, interaces with your git repository and allow you to stage and commit changes to your forked repository.  Additonally, you edit, debug and compile all of you scripts directly in the program without ever having to touch the toolset.

## Letting the team know about issues with the module

[Coming soon! ~~Read the Issues tutorial~~](docs/issues.md)

This is for team members and players.  For players, you can submit bugs you find in-game.  For team members, you can request help with issues and attach those request to specific files in a pull request.  If you're not familiar with the Issues functionality on GitHub, [this tutorial](docs/issues.md) is for you.

## Adding to our Wiki

[Coming soon! ~~Read the Wiki tutorial~~](docs/wiki.md)

The wiki pages on this site should contain documentation on the major system of the module, as well as story background and other information.  If you want to contribute to our wiki, but don't know how, [this tutorial](docs/wiki.md) is for you.
